This is a fork of [S4r4h-O's HRT Calendar](https://github.com/S4r4h-O/HRT-Calendar-Calend-rio-de-TH), which works offline. I wanted to make a version using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) just so I could host it on the web. Feel free to suggest additions. This will be hosted using Streamlit Community Cloud when I'm done, hopefully.
